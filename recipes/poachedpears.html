    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's something about poaching pears that adds a sophisticated touch to every meal. Maybe it's in the hints of spice, or perhaps the luscious syrup that the pears spend a lot of time in. There's nothing as yummy as a nice, tender pear.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Pears</li>
        <li>1 cup Sugar</li>
        <li>250 ml Water</li>
        <li>1 cup Honey</li>
        <li>1 Vanilla bean</li>
        <li>1 Cinnamon stick</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use a vegetable peeler to peel each of your whole pears. Cut them in half, cutting the stems off and taking the seeds out. </li>
            <li>Put your water, sugar, and honey into a large saucepan and heat until sugar dissolves, stirring occasionally in a circular motion. It's important to heat this on low to medium heat, as we aren't boiling the water.</li>
            <li>Once the sugar dissolves, place pear halves and cinnamon sticks into the water. Make sure the surface of the liquid is low enough so that a tiny bit of the pears remain uncovered. Simmer on medium-low heat for 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>When 25 minutes have passed, test out your pears. Try sticking a knife into them. You'll know they're done when the knife easily slides in and out of them. Take them out with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel for a few minutes to cool off.</li>
            <li>Cut the pears into little strips, toss them into a recipe, or eat them by the handful.</li>
        </ol>
